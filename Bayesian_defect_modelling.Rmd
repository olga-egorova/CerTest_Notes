## Framework

Bayesian model calibration is to be adopted for making the inference on the material and/or defect parameters $\xi$ based on the observed defective samples, and through forward modelling by defining a defect as a deformation field parameterised by $\xi$. 
The posterior derived for (calibration) parameters $\xi$ is then used for further FE modelling in order to assess their effect on material strength.
