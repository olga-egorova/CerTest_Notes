This folder contains some code dealing with a toy example considering a "made up" data of displacements from a cantilever beam and the outputs of the computer model described in "py_comp" -- can be found on this Github page as well (originally froked from Tim Dodwell's directory). 
Running this code in python is not necessary, as all the outputs and setups, together with all the outputs from the code in R are saved in "out" folders.

- "Single_beam" folder contains the original calibration setup, where the aim is to obtain a posterior inference on the angle misalignments in the three layers (the details are given in each of the .Rmd files, accompanied by .html ones)

- "Single_beam_two_thetas" folder has the example with the reduced number of calibration parameters of interest, with the third angle misalignment being set to 0

- "Single_beam_nonisotropic_error" folder contains the case of non-isotropic variance of thee discrepancy term: both at the artificial data geneeration step and at the fitting step

Each of the folders contain the main .Rmd file, the knitted/compiled .html file, .stan files with the models.
